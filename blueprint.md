# SoulSync - App Blueprint

## Overview

SoulSync is a Flutter application designed to help track daily mood, emotions, and overall well-being for multiple clients. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for a practitioner or user to log feelings for different individuals, identify influencing factors, and reflect on their day. The app aims to promote mindfulness and self-awareness, empowering users to better understand emotional patterns and take small steps towards a healthier mental state, with a clear overview of all clients.

## Implemented Features

### Core Features

- **Client-based Logging**: The app supports logging for different individuals by asking for a name at the start.
- **Multi-step Mood Journal**: A guided, multi-step process for logging mood and related factors.
- **Data Persistence (Session)**: Logs are stored in a static list (`clientLogs`) for the duration of the app session.
- **Summary Screen**: After completing a log, a summary screen displays all the captured information.
- **Declarative Routing**: Uses `go_router` for navigation.
- **Loading Screen**: A cheerful, animated loading screen is displayed when the app starts.
- **Offline First & Authentication Removal**: The app is designed to be used offline. All login, signup, and password reset functionalities have been removed.
- **Simplified Home Screen**: A new home screen that prompts for a client's name and starts a new session.

### Styling and Design

- **Cheerful Custom Theme**: The app features a custom theme with a bright, cheerful color scheme (yellow, orange, pink gradients) and uses Google Fonts for a unique, friendly look and feel.
- **Gradient Background**: A subtle gradient background is used throughout the app for a visually appealing and calming effect.
- **Consistent UI**: The app uses styled components like `ChoiceChip`, `ElevatedButton`, and `Card` for a polished and consistent user interface.
