# Project Blueprint

## Overview

A Flutter application for mood tracking.

## Style, Design, and Features

### Initial Setup
- Basic Flutter counter app.

- **Sign-Up Screen:** A screen for users to create a new account.

## Current Plan

### Goal: Create a Login Screen

1.  **Create `lib/screens/login_screen.dart`:** Implement the login screen UI with a title, prompts, fields for Email and Password, and buttons for "Forgot Password" and "Log In".
2.  **Update `lib/main.dart`:** Set the `LoginScreen` as the `home` widget in `MaterialApp` to display it on launch.
3.  **Add Navigation:** Add a button to the `SignupScreen` to navigate to the `LoginScreen`.
4.  **Format Code:** Run `dart format .` to maintain code quality.
